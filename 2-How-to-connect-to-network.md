# How to connect

We are currently in early alpha testing of independent RPC operators.

Connecting to our network currently involves three steps:

1) Submitting your RPC Server IP address to our performance-auditor for pass/fail assessment.

2) After audit is passed, submission into the global traffic engine.

3) Verifying connection to health check bots in SSC DAO discord channel and confirming calls are properly serving.
